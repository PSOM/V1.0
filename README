V01.0 - 2017/12/08.

*********************
* WARNING

PSOMv1.0 is a work in progress and should be considered as a beta version of PSOMv0.63. Changes made from PSOMv0.63 (https://github.com/PSOM/V0.63) ans implemented in PSOM v1.0 have not been tested yet and should be used with caution

This new version implements some of the changes developed sing PSOMv0.63, which include but are not limited to:
- New particles.f90 routines, with the possibility of prescribing sinking-velocities
- New format for netcdf outputs.
- Other important changes.

* GENERAL DESCRIPTION

PSOM, pronounced "soam" (the nectar derived from the churning of the oceans in Indian mythology), stands for Process Study Ocean Model. 
It is a versatile, three-dimensional, non-hydrostatic, computational fluid dynamical model for oceanographic (as well as other) applications (Mahadevan et al., 1996a,b). 
The model uses the finite volume method on a structured grid with boundary fitted coordinates (topography conforming sigma grid in the vertical, and boundary conforming in the horizontal). 
The model has a free-surface. It can be used for large- and small-scale phenomena and can be run in hydrostatic or non-hydrostatic mode (Mahadevan, 2006). It uses a highly efficient solution procedure that exploits the skewness arising from the small geometrical aspect (depth to length scale) ratio of the ocean to speed up the solution of the non-hydrostatic pressure, which is solved by the multigrid method. 

The model has been used for a number of process studies, including investigation of the vertical transport of nutrients for phytoplankton production (Mahadevan and Archer, 2000) and the dynamics of submesoscale processes (Mahadevan and Tandon, 2006; Mahadevan, Tandon and Ferrari, 2010). Since the non-hydrostatic model is well-posed with open boundaries, it can be used as a nested high-resolution model with time-varying boundary conditions applied from a coarser resolution general circulation model (Mahadevan and Archer, 1998). The model is thus ideally suited for high-resolution, limited-region modeling studies. 


*********************************
* DIRECTIONS TO INSTALL THE MODEL

- Download the code by clicking on "ZIP" just to the left of the repository URL field.
- Once the file is dowloaded, unzip it: a directory, with a name like " V0.5-master ", should be created.
- You can move this directory anywhere you like.
- Go to this " V0.5-master/code " directory and follow the instructions detailed in the file " GET_STARTED_1 ".
