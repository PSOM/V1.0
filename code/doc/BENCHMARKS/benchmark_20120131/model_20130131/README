V20120227. 2012/02/27, JBG.
This version is the first to fit the new structure.

* From Jinbow's version, the model has been altered to match Amala's version on the wiggle case. These modifications are listed in src/list_of_actions.
* To fit the structure, a small number of modifications have been made: 
    - mymodules.f90 has become header.f90.
    - an additional variable has been created "dirout" to create output in a separate file. Main, write_op, writeksurf, smooth, topog have been slightly altered.  


A few rules :
* For modules, the X.f90 file must contain the X module. Otherwise, genmakefilel will not work.
 * The @ symbol is used as a special character and should not be used in .f90 files or in optfile.
