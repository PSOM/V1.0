* Here are all the actions I had to do to make Jinbow's version match with Amala's.

copied stprofile_X
copied viscous
changed namelist
changed grid.h
got rid of sponge
got rid of load_dy
got rid of load_r
got rid of relaxation
****************************
added:
229 !     CALL ini_rho()
230      call stprofile
231      call evalrho(rho,0)
****************************
shifted from variable to constant grid
100             ydv(i,j)= dy/LEN !- used for constant dy
101 !           ydv(i,j)= dyM(j)/LEN 

***************************
added in mod_grids:
      yc(0) = -0.5*dy*1.d-3 
      do j=1,NJ+1 
         yc(j)= yc(j-1) + dy*1.d-3 
      end do 
      xc(0) = -0.5*dx*1.d-3 
      do i=1,NI+1 
         xc(i)= xc(i-1) + dx*1.d-3 
      end do 
declared them properly

***************************
added write*.f90 subroutines for visualization purposes.
in them, replaced USE dimensions by : USE header,ONLY : NI,NJ,NK,ntr,nconsume


*************************

pb in geostroph at t=0
tried to replace by old geostroph.


**************************
Shifted from f to beta-plane
Modified init_tr
   DO  j=0,NJ+1
 57      latrad(j)= phi0 + DBLE(j-jmid)*dphi 
 58      !latrad(j)= phi0                                               
 59   enddo

************************
Set RR=0 in diffusion_wind
