V0.41 - 2013/01/11. JBG.

- mod_io.f90 has been modified to compile with gfortran.

- The structure has been created in that way: code/{exe,mkfile,{model,model_build}/{src,inc}} .
- genmakefilel and compile_complex.sh have been written and tested in several configurations, but needs some additional tests.
- 20120227: psom (versionfrom JBW) has been fitted into the abovementioned structure.
- 20120302: the code has been modified to meet the fortran 2003 standard:
               * Most importantly, the declaration has been changed into the new standard. REAL*8 becomes REAL(kind=...), the old 'CHARACTER*' type is removed.
               * ENDDOs have been added to get rid of multiple ENNDDOs.
               * Some variables were not declared the right way.
               * dtime is now used in a much clearer way: dtime when global, dtimel when local.
               * NAMELIST has been moved to meet the standard
    -> With -real size 64: No difference at all.
    -> Without -real size 64, the results are identical at 1e-7.
    The -real size 64 is not necessary anymore to get realistic features.
    
- 20120305: dabs, dsqrt, dexp (old versions of abs, sqrt, exp for kind=2 (!)) have been removed from the code.
    No impact on the output.

- 20120323 and 28: Improved portability for netcdf subroutines.
 Should work with netcdf4.

- 201203028: Made the particles calculation optional. 

- 20120402: Enabled to choose pgf95.

- 20120417: Several small modifications:
               * cleaned the declarations
               * main has been slightly reorganized
	       * enabled to use the model without netcdf (see below)
               * enabled to choose the output format: netcdf or binary. First step toward a much better way to get output...
               * slight changes in tools/compile_complex.sh

- 20120504:
	* Improved the installation process. tools/configure.sh makes the start easier.
        * outpv and outcdf are back in the model.

-20120515:
        * Enabled to use the code with rho instead of s,T.
        * modified the namelist (got rid of Kx_* and Ky_*, introduced Kx and Ky, introduced fplane variable)
        * write_op include is now a subroutine.


-20120607:
        * Enabled the model to run in rhoonly.
	* namelist has been cleared and initializes values for diffusion, and enables to choose between f-plane and fully variable f.
        * header has been cleared.
        * n2budget has been removed.
        * calls to 1D, 2D, 3D netcdf output has been made.
        * multiple experiences can be lead with compile_complex.sh.
        * tools/test_energy.sh enables a simple check of the consistency of your executable with our standard simulation.


- a lot to do:
   - work on the boundary conditions.
   - improve the calculation of rp with topogaphy.
   - improve the portability.
   - add comments.
   - improve the user-friendliness.

Additional interesting readings:
  * GET_STARTED_* : being able to start quickly and also make some basic modifications.
  * src/README : all about the modifications of psom itself.
  * the scripts in tools are commented (or will soon be).
  * optfile is also roughly commented.
